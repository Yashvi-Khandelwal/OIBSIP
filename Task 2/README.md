# Guess the Number Game

## Description
This Java program implements a simple "Guess the Number" game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 99. The program prompts the user to enter their guess, provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low, and congratulates the user upon guessing the correct number.

## File Structure
- `oibsip_task2.java`: This file contains the Java source code for the Guess the Number game.
- `README.md`: This file provides information about the program.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
3. Navigate to the directory where the `oibsip_task2.java` file is located.
4. Compile the Java program by typing: `javac oibsip_task2.java`
5. Run the compiled program by typing: `java oibsip_task2`
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Gameplay
- The program generates a random number between 0 and 99.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program displays "THE NUMBER IS SMALL".
- If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program displays "THE NUMBER IS LARGE".
- If the user guesses the correct number, the program displays "CONGOOO!!....YOU ARE CORRECT!" and terminates.
- The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

## Note
- The program uses a `do-while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user for guesses until the correct number is guessed.
- The program terminates if the user enters a negative number.
- The random number generated by the program is also displayed at the end of the game.
